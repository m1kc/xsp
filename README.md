XSP is an open extensible socket-based protocol and XSP 1.0 is its implementation written on Java.

To build it using Ant, type:

    ant jar

To run it:

    java -jar dist/XSP.jar

To run it in developer mode (which allows you to open UI without establishing a connection, to emulate packet receiving and to use experimental features):

    java -jar dist/XSP.jar --developer
